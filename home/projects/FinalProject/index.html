        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        This paper presents a pattern generator in the form of a web application that enables discovery of novel designs based on generative grammars. It serves as a discovery tool for users to create, visualize, and tune context-free generative grammars using an interface that intuitively maps parameters to the rendered output. This application can serve as a tool for artists who wish to generate complex and rule-based patterns, textures, or designs without painstakingly drawing every pixel by hand -- this application is especially useful in an instance where many similar variations on a design are desired. Similar programs require the user to write code themselves (limiting the size of the possible audience)--while this application uses a simple graphical user interface to create varied and complex designs. Emphasis on sliders for parameter input allows users to explore the space of possible designs, but exact numbers can also be entered if precision is required. Furthermore, users can draw their own symbols, allowing any possible mapping of a string generated according to the rules of a context-free grammar to a rendered image. Several pre-made designs have been selected for their utility in showcasing the capabilities of the application. These include the rules to generate a Sierpinski triangle. Creating this application required research into L-systems, generative grammars, procedural modeling, and Turtle graphics, as well as an iterative design approach that led to a user-friendly non-coding-based solution to the problem of visualizing rule-based systems with user-determined constraints.
