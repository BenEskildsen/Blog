 - - - - - - WISH - - - - - -

 - undo/redo for editor actions
 - more intuitive picker for buttons in editor

 - - - - - - REFACTOR - - - - - -
 - pull out modal/button creation

 - - - - - - DONE - - - - -
 - level editor
  - select grid squares
  - (slightly) better styling for highlighting selected grid square
  - actions and (unstyled) buttons for adding walls to each side of selected square
  - actions for adding doors and buttons as well
  - drop in and play level at any time (set start location, reset level state)
  - output finished level as json or something
  - add doors to maze via buttons and checkbox
  - sidebar with options for walls and buttons
  - set finish location
  - set step limit in editor
  - disable modal to next level in editor
  - better styling for sidebar
  - need to be able to lose focus on the button selector dropdown too...
  - ability to delete walls/doors/buttons somehow
 - outer wall of starting maze is already filled
 - rumble when you try to make an impossible move
 - indication when you lose
 - modal system for instructions, telling you when you lose..
 - prevent focus from going to RESET button et al
 - limited number of steps to make it through the maze the first time
 - prevent going back in time on top of another agent
 - detect when you can't move or reverse time and pop "you lose" modal
 - motivation to reverse time in the first place (finish location?)
 - finish location should beat out running out of steps
 - prevent moving while modal is showing
 - prevent reversing time before the first time you make it through the maze
 - render the target as... something
 - display which level you're on
 - progress to next level on completion
 - don't collide with where an agent currently is, only where they will be
 - indicate that you must press space to "go back in time" (<-- and use that wording!)
 - fix button creation dropdown to display all options
 - handle case on level 3 where you can just pass through yourself because you never
   occupy the same spot (that should be a case handled separately)
 - add a reset button
 - fix getting stuck detection
 - better indicator for which player you are
 - modal for introducing the game
 - better way of choosing levels
 - modal for when you beat the last level
 - modal on first level when you reach the button telling you to move
 - modal on second level when you get stuck reminding to reverse time
 - split out the systems in index.js
 - multiple levels
 - animation when you reverse time (like a growing and rotating hourglass)
 - better styling for modals
 - better styling for main menu
 - add favicon
 - paste level json somewhere to play custom level
 - cookie to track level progress
 - pass moveReducer and reverseTimeReducer the full state
 - Back to Main Menu button next to reset
 - show agents moving backwards when you reverse time
 - fix bug where you go back to main menu and it's trying to reverse time over and over
 - fix tutorial modals to work with reversing time animation
 - selector for player agent, etc.
 - playable on mobile
 - put on github
 - edit Vance's level to be workable
 - Don't close doors until the end of the reverse time animation
 - Show character holding time machine
 - More open first level
