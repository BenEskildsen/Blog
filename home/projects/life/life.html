				Exploring the state space of cellular automata. 
				<p></p>We can find some really weird behavior: create:3;starve:4;suffocate7;seed:65% is just an oozing mass of cells that slowly congeals. But then create:3;starve:5;suffocate7;seed:65% just immediately decays to nothing. Other automata of interest: 
					<ul>
						<li>create:3; starve:4; suffocate:8; seed:55%</li> 
						<li>create:3; starve:5; suffocate:8; seed:65%</li>
						<li>create:3; starve:2; suffocate:4; seed:5%</li>
						<li>create:3; starve:2; suffocate:3; seed:15% (note that these are Conway's rules)</li>
						<li>These are getting harder to categorize. What was the last one? Decaying really slowly? Or just congealing?</li>
						<li>create:2; starve:2; suffocate:3; seed:5% This is just static!</li>
						<li>create:3; starve:2; suffocate:6; seed:99%</li>
						<li>create:3; starve:2; suffocate:4; seed:50% vs create:4; starve:2; suffocate:4; seed:50% </li>
					</ul>

			I had meant for this post to be a lot more in-depth study of CA's, but it's been taking me so long to make any progress at all on that front that I've decided to just post this as-is and let any reader explore as they wish. I'll come back to CA's at some point.
