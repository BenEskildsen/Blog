I realized yesterday that I've made a big mistake in how I set this up. Using the stencils
consisting of the 6 neighboring cells is no good because the ant can dig down but can never get out of the tunnel it just dug because for a moment it would have to float above the hole. No matter what
I need to go back in and make the neighborhood of possible next-cells larger. But honestly the
whole stencil idea seems not very good: multiple behaviors are being pigeon-holed into stencils
when they are really just trying to get the ant to move in a certain direction. So I'm going to go
back in and tear out the stencils and replace them with vectors. Every ant will decide where to go
next by summing a bunch of vectors and moving to the neighboring cell (in the larger, 26-cube
neighborhood) which the vector goes through. In order to implement this switch I will need to:

-- Add stuff for not colliding with other ants and for not going off the screen or hitting dirt/
digging.
-- Fix my documentation/comments to reflect this change

Lez go
