Since collecting the images and data for the rest of this was time-consuming and not required, I've just filled out
the images for the three views from PMRP -> North 40 -> Amarillo Sunset, though the other tabs are still clickable (they
just have no content). The images are from Google search and the information is from the book
Red River Gorge Rock Climbs by Ray Ellington, from MountainProject.com, and from personal experience.
