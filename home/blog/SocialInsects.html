			<h1><i>Caste and Ecology in the Social Insects</i></h1>
      <h2>by Edward Wilson and George Oster</h2>
			<h3>1/5/2020</h3>

      I've probably read only around 5 books per year since I graduated from college.
      This year I'm resolving to read 10 times as many -- one per week.
      <p></p>
      Reading slowly has its advantages, though. The books I've read in the last three years
      have had time to percolate and assimilate into my memory and I can still recite
      obscure factoids from them. Richard Nixon founded a fraternity at Whittier college
      called the Orthogonians. In the lead up to the 1953 Iran coup that re-installed
      the Shah, 4 out of the 5 Tehran newspapers were on the CIA's payroll.
      <p></p>
      But now that I've finished my first book of 2020, I've had only a few hours
      to process it in its entirety and I'll already be starting the next one this afternoon.
      So I'm going to record my thoughts on it here. Maybe I'll do the same for the rest
      of them.
      <p></p>
      I picked up <i>Caste and Ecology in the Social Insects</i> by chance at a
      labyrinthine used bookstore in Ohio. The book is from 1978 and it's possible
      no one has read it since then (between the pages I found an old airplane
      ticket I used as a bookmark that had rules explaining the plane's smoking section!).
      In fact it's possible no one has read <i>any</i> copy of the book since the 70s
      as it doesn't even make E. O. Wilson's top 30 "Main Works" listed on Wikipedia.
      However since I am recently in the business of knowing as much as possible about
      ants I gave this one a read.
      <p></p>
      The book is filled with math. Differential equations make an appearance in every chapter,
      as do charts and graphs of every variety. Wilson and Oster set out to
      mathematically formulate the basis of physical castes in the social insects
      (mainly ants, but also bees, wasps, and termites). In insects, "castes" refer
      to groups of individuals of the same species with different physical attributes
      (most obviously body size) that therefore exhibit different behaviors. For example
      leafcutter ant colonies consist of tiny "minima" ants that tend the colony's
      symbiotic fungus, minor and major "workers" that cut and transport the leaves
      that feed the fungus, comparatively huge "soldiers" that have no task except to
      fight predators, and the even larger queen who is the sole parent of all the others
      (the males die shortly after mating).
      <p></p>
      The worker castes are notable in that they are discrete --
      there are no ants whose bodies partially match a major worker and partially
      match a soldier. So instead of simple variance producing workers along a
      normally-distributed spectrum of size, some other biological mechanism bucketizes
      ants into discrete castes with little variance within each caste. They briefly
      cover what the biological mechanisms might be, but focus more on why having
      castes at all would be evolutionarily beneficial.
      <p></p>
      The book attempts to explain the caste differentiation of social insects like
      the leafcutter ants in mathematical terms by arguing that producing ants of different sizes
      allows the colony to more optimally propagate its genes to future generations.
      Their model is to take the set of all tasks that ants perform and
      plot them in a multi-dimensional space where the location of the task in this
      space defines the morphology of an ant that optimally performs that task (note
      that they don't actually plot the tasks of any specific species of ant, but rather just
      offer this concept theoretically). One could plot a sphere around each task that delineates the boundary
      beyond which the ant's body shape makes the task impossible to complete.
      The set of all task-spheres forms a sort of cloud of ant body shapes required to
      accomplish all tasks posed to the colony. Then they argue that, depending on the
      distribution of tasks specific to a given species, splitting workers into discrete
      physical castes more optimally matches this task-cloud than having a simple
      normal distribution of ant body attributes.
      <p></p>
      Sounds plausible, right? (Well, maybe. I just covered in four sentences
      what Wilson and Oster cover in three chapters, so maybe the previous
      paragraph doesn't make any sense at all...) Regardless, this model falls short in three ways:
      <p></p>
      Most social insect species don't even have physical castes outside of the queen-worker
      dichotomy. Edward Wilson (and pretty much every ant biologist I've read) was obsessed
      with division of labor by caste in ant colonies like leafcutters, but this kind of
      organization is the exception in social insects, not the rule. Fully 80% of
      social insect genera have only a single monomorphic worker caste where division of labor
      is entirely behavioral instead of physical. And only four genera have more than two castes.
      Instead, most ants expand their optimal task-cloud by coordinating their efforts
      and working together instead of producing individual ants optimized for the job. The
      book barely touches on ant coordination and cooperation at all.
      <p></p>
      The model implies causality where there might not be: they argue that
      an ant species like the leafcutters evolved multiple castes to better fit
      the array of tasks at hand, but it could just as well have been that they
      already had multiple physical castes for other reasons and then later adopted the set of tasks
      we observe and simply don't perform whole realms of other possible tasks unsuited to their bodies
      (e.g. breaking open seeds or hunting small arthropods).
      <p></p>
      Finally, who is to say that evolution would bring about the optimization of
      anything at all? For any given biological trait, it is impossible to attribute
      its existence to any particular adaptation that trait enables. For example, it is
      not true that giraffes have long necks "just so" they can eat the leaves off of
      tall trees. Male giraffes also use their necks in fights with each other
      (definitely look up giraffe fights on Youtube, it's wild). But just because
      giraffes use their necks for those things doesn't mean evolution gave them
      long necks for those specific purposes. On the other hand evolution didn't
      act totally randomly as clearly along the line somewhere some zebra-things with longer
      necks than their siblings produced more-viable offspring. The only real
      conclusion we can make about the evolution of specific traits is that they
      are partially the result of direct fitness gains, partially the result of
      the fitness gains of <i>other</i> traits that must go together because of
      quirky mechanisms of that species' biology, and partially because those traits
      randomly occurred in individuals and weren't <i>so bad</i> for them that
      they couldn't still survive and reproduce.
      <p></p>
      Wilson and Oster address some shortcomings of their approach in the book,
      but in my opinion they offer only weak justifications for why their arguments
      supersede the above pitfalls, mainly centering around the need for more empirical studies.
      Regardless, reading this was a good exercise for me in quickly digesting dense non-fiction.
      I also learned some interesting factoids I will share here:
      <p></p>
      Wilson categorizes ant colonies into three developmental phases: founding,
      the "ergonomic" growth phase when the colony produces exclusively sterile
      workers that help grow the colony further, and the reproductive phase when
      the colony "cashes in" its investment in numerical growth to produce
      exclusively new reproductive females and males. In one chapter, they show
      mathematically that this strategy of producing only sterile offspring followed
      by producing only reproductive offspring is genetically optimal for colonies whose workers
      cannot survive the winter. They call this a "bang-bang" reproductive strategy.
      And here I thought the term "bang-bang" was invented by Louis C.K. to refer
      to eating two full meals one after the other. Also, during the peak of the
      reproductive stage fully 70% of a colony's individuals could be otherwise-useless
      young queens and males. The colony has to be so efficient to support so many
      individuals who aren't contributing!
      <p></p>
      At least in 1978, it was thought that 13 families of insects independently
      developed eusociality (that is, form colonies where some members reproduce and some
      only help raise their siblings but don't reproduce themselves). 12 of these
      were in the ants, bees, and wasps, and then once in termites. Wasps and bees
      have practically no instances of discrete physical castes, and ants mostly
      are monomorphic as well. But termites almost all have very well-delineated
      roles and castes within their colonies. Maybe the book would have done better
      focusing on termites instead of ants. Termites rarely forage since they feed
      on fungus that they tend, and besides the occasional exterminator their primary
      threat is coordinated attacks by ants, so it makes sense why some individuals
      might develop specialized traits to fight them (see the termite vs ant battle in the movie Antz).
      <p></p>
      Lastly, Wilson and Oster noted that along with division of labor ants also have
      a division of initiative. A small minority of workers are more adventurous and
      active than their siblings and are the primary scouts and defenders. The rest are
      only stirred to action after being recruited by their more vigorous nestmates. I had imagined
      ant colonies as consisting of entirely interchangeable members, but apparently some
      are more independent than others. This might be an adaptation though since
      docile ants are more likely to help out their nestmates than be off on their own
      adventures. This is most striking in the slave driver ants that send one ant in
      each direction to look for neighboring ant colonies to pillage. When a lone
      ant returns knowing the location of prey, it sets off a chain reaction of
      communication and alert that spurs the entire colony to follow it to its target.
      <p></p>
      This turned out longer than I intended (and took three hours to write!), but
      will hopefully be a good resource for me to return to down the line in order to refresh myself
      on this book. I might even write another review next week, especially if this one is received well.
      I also want to try to improve this webpage since I set it up back in 2013.
